# Driving Through Graphs: A Bipartite Graph for Traffic Scene Analysis

## Overview
We introduce a novel approach for traffic scene analysis in driving videos using frame-to-frame (f2f) bipartite graphs. Our method models multi-object interactions with minimal computational cost by relying on object bounding boxes and a graph-based framework.

The proposed technique significantly improves the accuracy and efficiency of traffic scene analysis, providing a promising solution for autonomous driving technologies.
