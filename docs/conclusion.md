# Conclusion

The proposed graph-based approach enhances the understanding of multi-object interactions in traffic scenes, leading to improved performance in traffic scene analysis. Our method shows potential for enhancing autonomous driving systems.

Future work will focus on expanding the model to handle more complex driving scenarios and integrating other sensory data.
