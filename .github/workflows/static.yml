# Driving Through Graphs: A Bipartite Graph for Traffic Scene Analysis

## Overview
We introduce a novel approach for traffic scene analysis in driving videos using frame-to-frame (f2f) bipartite graphs. Our method models multi-object interactions with minimal computational cost by relying on object bounding boxes and a graph-based framework.

The proposed technique significantly improves the accuracy and efficiency of traffic scene analysis, providing a promising solution for autonomous driving technologies.

## Introduction
Driving action recognition is crucial for the safety and reliability of autonomous vehicles. This project addresses challenges in accurately interpreting driving actions by utilizing graph neural networks (GNNs) for video-based traffic scene analysis.

---

## Methodology
Our approach consists of two main components:
1. **Graph Construction**: We create a temporal frame-to-frame bipartite graph to model object interactions across frames.
2. **Interaction Aware GNN (IA-GNN)**: We process the graph with a specialized GNN that incorporates dynamic edge attributes, computed using multilayer perceptrons (MLPs).

---

## Experiments
We evaluate our approach on two datasets:
- **METEOR Dataset**: Contains 1250 videos of various traffic scenes with over 2 million annotated frames.
- **INTERACTION Dataset**: Consists of birdâ€™s-eye view traffic footage from different traffic scenarios.

---

## Results
Our model achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, with significant improvements in both accuracy and mean average precision (mAP).
